# Running the challenge code

## Virtual environment

This project was set up using python vertual environment to eliminate
any requirements on the local system.

To run this project, either use an IDE that supports venv or activate the venv using the CLI
with the commands relevant to the operating system you are using

(see https://python.ladn/virtual-environments/virtualenv)

in linux this would be
`$ source {directory}/bin/activate`

## Input parameters

this program expects two input parameters, one for the input file, and one for the output file.

e.g. `py main.py input.txt output.txt`

it will expect these to be relative to the `main.py` file

## Unit testing

use `python -m unittest unittests`
or your IDE to run the unit tests.
